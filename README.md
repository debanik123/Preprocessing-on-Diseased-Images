# Preprocessing-on-Diseased-Images
The proposed method is applied on simulated rice disease image dataset[6] for the prediction of different rice diseases. The acquired image may contain different noises from environment, image capturing devices etc. which are removed by various noise removal techniques to increase the quality of the image.In the paper, bilateral filter [7] is used for noise removal and smoothing the images while preserving edges where the intensity value at each pixel in an image is replaced by a weighted average of intensity values from nearby pixels.For strip detection and shadow pixel removal, Canny edge detection algorithm [8]is applied on the image. Adaptive histogram [9] is used in order to carry out contrast enhancement by equalizing the pixel intensity value. After equalization, the image edges become more prominent compared to the original image.The images are segmented using Otsuâ€™s method [10]. After preprocessing, Rice disease dataset is prepared from 500 infected rice plant images having 31 features with four disease classes. The four disease classes are Rice blast caused by fungus named PyriculariaGrisea, Sheath Rot caused by Pathogen named Sarocladiumoryzae, Leaf brown spot caused by fungus Bipolarisoryza, and Bacterial Blight caused by bacteria Xanthomonasoryzae.
